'''
âœ… I've created a complete professional **frontend interface** for your Flask book API using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:

* View all books
* Add a new book
* Delete a book by ID

The interface uses `fetch()` to interact with your existing API endpoints.

Let me know if youâ€™d like to:

* Add **edit/update functionality**
* Convert this into a **React app**
* Make it look better with **Bootstrap or Tailwind**
* Package it into the same Docker container as your Flask API
